INSTALL
----------------------------------------------------
This should be as easy as putting all the files where you want them.

Make sure that .htaccess is accessible in the root directory of frontend/ and admin/

And just running:
mysql -u<username> -p<password> <database> < database/voteapp_core.sql

The default username is 'admin' and the password is 'voteapp'.

For the api configuration to work for FRONTEND and ADMIN pages, edit the config.php in each directory
and point to the correct url where API folder is located...
Only the API folder contains database configuration in it's config.php.
Default database name, username and password is "voteapp" and the default hostname is localhost
